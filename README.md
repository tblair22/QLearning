# QLearning

- Q learning is a free reinforcement model learning algorithm which learns a policy that gets the best option efficiently. Model free just means it does not need to have a the model of the environment. Q learning can handle environments that change and rewards without changing the learning algorithm. The Q stands for quality because the algorithm finds the most quality option in the environment. 

- Reinforcement learning is learning through doing something a lot of times until the program or thing finds the best way. Machine learning can then use the data to make decisions without humans telling the program to do so. It is also artificial intelligence and is one of the many ways computers can use AI.

- This means that the algorithm doesn't have to have any environment and it can still run.

- Q learning is most used for finding the most efficent and best paths in an environment. This project has a list but I like the third one of a self-driving truck in a video game that uses Q-learning to get better- https://machinelearningknowledge.ai/reinforcement-learning-github-repositories-to-give-you-project-ideas/
